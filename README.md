This repository is my walkthrough of the book [Learn Go with Tests](
https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/). After landing a job at Uber as a
backend software engineer, I'm learning Go since it's their primary language.

I'm using this book to learn Go using a test-driven approach. That way, I can,
at the same time, learn the Go language and its best practices.

The book contains 21 chapters and my goal is to complete all of them by the
beginning of 2025. Today is 14/12/2024, so I have to do about one chapter per
day. Let's find out if I can do it =)

In the meantime, I'm also looking for online free resources to learn Go and get
in touch with its community and content creators.
